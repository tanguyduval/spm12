This may\n     help removing artefacts and non-brain parts, e.g. eyes, from the mask.\n\nOPTIONS\n\n  -clean_scale value\n     the maximum scale used to cut bridges. A certain maximum scale cuts\n     bridges up to a width (in voxels) of 2x the provided scale. Setting this\n     to 0 disables the mask cleaning step. (Default: 2)\n\nDW gradient table import options\n\n  -grad file\n     Provide the diffusion-weighted gradient scheme used in the acquisition in\n     a text file. This should be supplied as a 4xN text file with each line is\n     in the format [ X Y Z b ], where [ X Y Z ] describe the direction of the\n     applied gradient, and b gives the b-value in units of s\/mm^2. If a\n     diffusion gradient scheme is present in the input image header, the data\n     provided with this option will be instead used.\n\n  -fslgrad bvecs bvals\n     Provide the diffusion-weighted gradient scheme used in the acquisition in\n     FSL bvecs\/bvals format files. If a diffusion gradient scheme is present in\n     the input image header, the data provided with this option will be instead\n     used.\n\n  -bvalue_scaling mode\n     specifies whether the b-values should be scaled by the square of the\n     corresponding DW gradient norm, as often required for multi-shell or DSI\n     DW acquisition schemes. The default action can also be set in the MRtrix\n     config file, under the BValueScaling entry. Valid choices are yes\/no,\n     true\/false, 0\/1 (default: true).\n\nStandard options\n\n  -info\n     display information messages.\n\n  -quiet\n     do not display information messages or progress status. Alternatively,\n     this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET environment variable to a\n     non-empty string.\n\n  -debug\n     display debugging messages.\n\n  -force\n     force overwrite of output files. Caution: Using the same file as input and\n     output might cause unexpected behaviour.\n\n  -nthreads number\n     use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to\n     disable multi-threading).\n\n  -help\n     display this information page and exit.\n\n  -version\n     display version information and exit.\n\nAUTHOR\n     David Raffelt (david.raffelt@florey.edu.au), Thijs Dhollander\n     (thijs.dhollander@gmail.com) and Ben Jeurissen\n     (ben.jeurissen@uantwerpen.be)\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n     Copyright (c) 2008-2018 the MRtrix3 contributors.\n     This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public\n     License, v. 2.0.
