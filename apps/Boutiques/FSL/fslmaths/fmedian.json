If the truth image contains negative voxels these get excluded from all calculations. If <AROC-thresh> is positive then the [4Dnoiseonly] option needs to be set, and the FP rate is determined from this noise-only data, and is set to be the fraction of timepoints where any FP (anywhere) is seen, as found in the noise-only 4d-dataset. This is then controlling the FWE rate. If <AROC-thresh> is negative the FP rate is calculated from the zero-value parts of the <truth> image, this time averaging voxelwise FP rate over all timepoints. In both cases the TP rate is the average fraction of truth=positive voxels correctly found.                     ",
